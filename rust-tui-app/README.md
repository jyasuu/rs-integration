I'll help you implement a TUI (Terminal User Interface) in Rust. The most popular and powerful library for this is `ratatui` (formerly `tui-rs`). Let me create a comprehensive example that demonstrates the key concepts.This is a comprehensive Rust TUI application using `ratatui` that demonstrates most of the key concepts you'll need:

## Key Features:

**Core TUI Elements:**
- Multi-tab interface (Tasks, Stats, About)
- Interactive task list with keyboard navigation
- Popup dialogs for adding tasks and help
- Real-time progress bar with smooth animation
- Detailed task information panel

**Keyboard Controls:**
- `q` - Quit application
- `h`/`F1` - Show help
- `a` - Add new task
- `d` - Delete selected task
- `↑↓`/`j k` - Navigate tasks
- `Space`/`Enter` - Toggle task completion
- `Tab` - Switch between tabs
- `Esc` - Close popups

**Technical Highlights:**

1. **Layout Management** - Uses constraint-based layouts for responsive design
2. **State Management** - Proper application state with list selection
3. **Event Handling** - Keyboard input with different modes (Normal/Editing)
4. **Styling** - Colors, modifiers, and conditional styling
5. **Widgets** - Lists, paragraphs, gauges, tabs, and custom popups
6. **Real-time Updates** - Smooth progress animation with tick-based updates

## To run this:

1. Create a new Rust project: `cargo new rust-tui-app`
2. Replace the `Cargo.toml` and `src/main.rs` with the code above
3. Run with: `cargo run`

## Key Concepts Explained:

- **Terminal Setup**: Raw mode, alternate screen for full-screen apps
- **Event Loop**: Non-blocking input handling with configurable tick rate
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components (List, Paragraph, Block, etc.)
- **Layouts**: Flexible constraint-based positioning system
- **State Management**: Separating app logic from UI rendering
- **Styling**: Rich text formatting with colors and modifiers

This example provides a solid foundation that you can extend with additional features like file I/O, network requests, or more complex UI components. The architecture is modular and follows TUI best practices.
